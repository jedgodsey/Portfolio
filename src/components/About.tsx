      <h3>I take pride in being a Software Engineer who builds across the full stack and puts the user first. I’m an effective communicator who excels at asking the right questions and translates complex ideas into basic and relatable concepts. In my career I’ve developed a wealth of knowledge in popular frontend frameworks like React, and backend technologies like Python as well as both relational and non-relational databases. I hope to affect the world by using these skills to enhance the impact that other people have in their own lives. If you’ve ever wondered who you’d want on your team when everything is going against you, I am that guy.</h3>
